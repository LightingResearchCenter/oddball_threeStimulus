%replaceOutliers: replaces artifacts/outliers from data series
%
%Inputs:    t = time
%           y = ibi values
%           outliers = logical array of outliers. 0=normal, 1=outlier
%           method = artifact replacement method to use.
%   methods:    'remove' = Outliers are removed
%               'mean' = Outliers are replaced with mean value from nearest +- m ibi values.
%               'spline' = Outliers are replaced by cubic spline interpolation
%               'median' = Outliers are replaced with median value from nearest +- m ibi values.
%Outputs:   t2, y2 = arrays with replaced artifacts
%Examples: 
%   remove outliers from ibi series
%       [t2 y2] = replaceOutlers(t,y, outlierArray,'remove')

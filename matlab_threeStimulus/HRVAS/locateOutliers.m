function outliers = locateOutliers(t,s, method, opt1, opt2)
%locateOutliers: locates artifacts/outliers from data series
%
%  Inputs:  s = array containg data series
%           method = artifact removal method to use.
%  methods: 'percent' = percentage filter: locates data > x percent diff than previous data point.               
%           'sd' = standard deviation filter: locates data > x stdev away from mean.
%           'above' = Threshold filter: locates data > threshold value
%           'below' = Threshold filter: locates data < threshold value
%           'median' = median filter. Outliers are located.
%Outputs:   outliers = logical array of whether s is artifact/outlier or not
%                       eg. - [0 0 0 1 0], 1=artifact, 0=normal
%                       
%Examples:
%   Locate outliers with 20% percentage filter:
%       outliers = locateOutlers(s,'percent',0.2)
%   Locate outliers that are above a threshold of 0.5:
%       outliers = locateOutlers(s,'thresh','above',0.5)
%   Locate outliers with median filter:
%       outliers = locateOutlers(s,'median',4,5)

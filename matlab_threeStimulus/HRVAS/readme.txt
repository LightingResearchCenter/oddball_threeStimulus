Program Description:
    HRVAS is a complete and self-contained heart rate variability analysis software 
    (HRVAS) package. HRVAS offers several preprocessing options. HRVAS offers time-domeain 
    , freq-domain, time-frequency, and nonlinear HRV analysis. All results can be exported
    to an Excel file. For processing many files HRVAS offers a bach processing feature.
    All settings/options can be saved to a .mat file and reloaded for future HRV analysis.
    Upon starting HRVAS all previously used settings/options are loaded.

MATLAB Toolbox Dependencies:
    1. Signal Processing Toolbox (used for PSD estimates)
    2. Wavelet Toolbox (used for wavelet and wavelet packet detrending)
    3. Curvefitting Toolbox (only needed if using the "smooth" function for detrending)

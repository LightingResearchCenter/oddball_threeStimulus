function [idx]=slidingWindow(s,winSize,overlap,method)
%windowArray - Seperates the input array s into smaller segments/windows with 
%lengths of winSize. winSize can be either in units of time or samples. 
%If winSize is given in units of time the first column of the input array 
%must containg time and method should be set to a value of 1. 
%
%INPUTS:
%   s: input array OR length of array. If outputing segs or using the time
%       methods, the 1st dim must contain time values.
%   winSize: size of segments to return
%   method: method of segmenting array (0=by samples, 1=by time)
%   overlap: amount that segments/windows overlap. 
%   flagCenters: decides whether to output center of windows instead of
%   beginning
%
%OUTPUTS:
%   idx: 2dim array that contains the start and end of each segment/window
%   centers: array containg locations of center of windows (useful when
%   using the time method)
%
%EXAMPLES:
%   1. Seperate input using window size of 100 seconds and overlap
%   of 50 seconds.
%   idx=slidingWindow(input,100,50,1);
%
%   2. Seperate input using window size of 128 samples and overlap
%   of 64 samples.
%   idx=slidingWindow(input,128,64,0);
%
%   3. Seperate input using window size of 128 samples and overlap
%   of 64 samples. Also outputs a cell array containing the actual segments
%   [idx, segs]=slidingWindow(input,128,64,0,1);

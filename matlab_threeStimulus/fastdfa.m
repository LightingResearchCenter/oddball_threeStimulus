% Performs fast detrended fluctuation analysis on a nonstationary input signal to
% obtain an estimate for the scaling exponent.
%
% Useage:
% [alpha, intervals, flucts] = fastdfa(x)
% [alpha, intervals, flucts] = fastdfa(x, intervals)
% Inputs
%    x          - input signal: must be a row vector
% Optional inputs
%    intervals  - List of sample interval widths at each scale
%                 (If not specified, then a binary subdivision is constructed)
%
% Outputs:
%    alpha      - Estimated scaling exponent
%    intervals  - List of sample interval widths at each scale
%    flucts     - List of fluctuation amplitudes at each scale

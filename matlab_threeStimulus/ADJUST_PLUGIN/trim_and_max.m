% after removing the top 1% of the values
% (to be outlier resistant)
%
% Usage:
%   >> valore=trim_and_max(vettore);
%
% Inputs:
%   vettore    - row vector
%
% Outputs:
%   valore     - result

% Motivation taken from the following comment to our paper:
% "On page 11 the authors motivate the use of the max5 function when computing
% Maximum Epoch Variance because the simple maximum would be too sensitive
% to spurious outliers. This is a good concern, however the max5 function would
% still be sensitive to spurious outliers for very large data sets. In other words, if
% the data set is large enough, one will be very likely to record more than five
% outliers. The authors should use a trimmed max function that computes the
% simple maximum after the top say .1% of the values have been removed from
% consideration. This rejection criteria scales appropriately with the size of the data
% set."

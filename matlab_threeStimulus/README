Matlab analysis files
....

To be documented better later, you can run:
"basic_cleaningOfRecording.m" for basic cleaning of EEG file if you are not doing event-related epochs or anything

The analysis relies on few 3rd party toolboxes:

EEG (general)
* The BioSig project (not included), http://biosig.sourceforge.net/
* EEGLAB (not included), so download and add to Matlab path, http://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/

DENOISING

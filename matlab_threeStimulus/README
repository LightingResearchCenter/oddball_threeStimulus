Matlab analysis files
....

To be documented better later, you can run:
"basic_cleaningOfRecording.m" for basic cleaning of EEG file if you are not doing event-related epochs or anything

The analysis relies on few 3rd party toolboxes:
* The BioSig project (not included), http://biosig.sourceforge.net/
* EEGLAB (not included), so download and add to Matlab path, http://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/
* ERPLAB (not included), http://erpinfo.org/erplab
* ERPWAVELAB (included) by Morten MÃ¸rup et al., no need to download, http://www.erpwavelab.org/
* MFDFA by Espen Ihlen (included), http://www.ntnu.edu/inm/geri/software
* Kardia for ECG by Perakakis et al.(included), http://sourceforge.net/projects/mykardia/
* HRVAS for ECG by John Ramshur (included), http://sourceforge.net/projects/hrvas/

and remember to add the subfolders in this repository to Matlab Path, as otherwsie they won't be found and your script will crash
